# Multilinear Algebra

This directory contains:
- The homework from my Msc. course "Algebra Multilinear", taught by André Lima Ferrer at UFC.
- Important sources can be found in the Articles directory in the Google Drive
- The homework is essentially a series of tensor decomposition techniques.
- The codes are mostly written in `Matlab`.
- The slides can be found in the Google Drive in path `Mathematics - Linear Algebra/Andre's slides - multilinear algebra/`

PS: The `.zip` files are the codes from other colleges that took the same course (in different semesters).
