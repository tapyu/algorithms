# Linear Algebra

- This directory contains homeworks of a Linear Algebra course (unknown professor) in which I wasn't a student. Therefore, the algorithms found here were implemented by other colleges that took this course.
- These Linear Algebra homeworks are basically a collection of matrix decompositions, implemented in `MATLAB`.

- Others:
  - **Golub, G.H. and Van Loan, C.F., 2013. Matrix computations. JHU press** - A more advanced book which focus more on the computational aspects of the algorithms.
  - **Horn, R.A. and Johnson, C.R., 2012. Matrix analysis. Cambridge university press** - An advanced book with a more in-depth mathematical analysis.
  - **Chapra, S., 2011. Applied Numerical Methods with MATLAB for Engineers and Scientists. McGraw Hill** (only part III: linear systems) - It focuses more on basic numerical methods to solve system of linear equations, whether via direct or iterative methods. It can be used as an auxiliary material.
