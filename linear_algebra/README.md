# Linear Algebra

- This directory contains homeworks of a Linear Algebra course (unknown professor) in which I wasn't a student. Therefore, the algorithms found here were implemented by other colleges that took this course.
- These Linear Algebra homeworks are basically a collection of matrix decompositions, implemented in `MATLAB`.

Resouces:
- [18.06 course at MIT: Linear Algebra (by Gilbert Strang)][1] and [its codes (in Julia <3)][2]
- Beaultiful graphs on the ["The Art of Linear Algebra"][3] (apparently these pictures were drawn by a japanese student of Gilbert Strang, who put them on his 6th ed book)
- [A tons of material from Gilbert Strang's book (exams, solution manual, etc)][4]
- A interesting discursion about the [modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS)][5] and the numerical issues with the classical one.

McGraw Hill** (only part III: linear systems) - It focuses more on basic numerical methods to solve system of linear equations, whether via direct or iterative methods. It can be used as an auxiliary material.
